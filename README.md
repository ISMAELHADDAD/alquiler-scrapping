# Alquiler scrapping

Small script for scraping rent listings and posting it to a telegram channel.

Fun died when I got caught as a bot and challenged with a captcha. I will not waste my time any more.

Set up:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
vim .env # Fill out the environment variables
```

To run:

```bash
go run .
```
